                    <h2>Hello Atte, tell us something about yourself?</h2>
                    <p>Well, I was born in February 1989 in Riihimäki, Finland and now I live in Helsinki. You can contact me by phone <a href="tel:+358503385667">+358503385667</a> or by email <a href="mailto:attenykanen@gmail.com">attenykanen@gmail.com</a> </p>

                    <h2>What is your work experience?</h2>
                    <p>Earlier this year I worked for Helsinki City Museum as a communications assistant. It was great; Even though my tasks were kind of routine things, updating web-sites and social media pages, answering emails, media-analysis etc. it was great working towards something everyone can appreciate in free of charge. And co-workers were excellent too! Too bad it was only a fixed-term job. <br><br>

                    Before that I worked in HAMK University of Applied Sciences in various positions ex. laboratory assistant, summer worker and technical trainee. Mostly worked with computers in the HAMK mediafactory where we made various projects for our clients, but I also did project management and I also designed a course module so I got to work with students too. Had a good time there too.  Other work history includes being a class aide in a junior high school in late 00's and such.

                    <h2>Alright, how about schools?</h2>
                    <p>Yeah, I graduated as an Engineer in media technology from HAMK University of Applied Sciences in December 2013.  My majors were 3D-visualization and multimedia projects and video technologies and programming were minors.. <br><br>
                    Before that I went to a gymnasium, because I didn't get in to a vocational school to study to become a media-assistant haha, so people from the gymnasium called if i wanted to study in there. But it was a good choice too!

                    <h2>What about your language skills, sprechen Sie Deutsch?</h2>
                    <p>Well I don't speak German, but Finnish is my native language and I'm proficient in English. And in Swedish too, but I don't use it as much so I have to remember all the words and sentence structures sometimes. But luckily google helps with that these days too!

                    <h2>What work skills or experience do you have?</h2>
                    <p>I got a lot of experience working with computers. I have used Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects and InDesign from Adobe in my previous jobs. I'm proficient with Office and I know my way in different social media platforms, whether it is Facebook, Instagram or Twitter just to name a few. And I have exprerience working with Wordpress content management and I can do a lot of basic web-development work, like make this site you are reading right now. And I got a lot of other industry knowledge too, whether you are making content for online, mobile or print media. Of course, not everything should be done with computers, I like human interaction and physical work too.</p>

                    <h2>Hey, there's you listed quite many skills there already! What about your hobbies? </h2>
                    <p>I've been skateboarding since I was a kid and I'm not going to stop any time soon. I have always loved music too. I buy a lot of records, work as a DJ, go to a shows and in past few years I have started to record my own music too. And then there's culture, art, books, movies, games and so forth. And eating pizza, but does that count as a hobby?

                    <h2>OK, tell us your strengths and weaknesses.</h2>
                    <p>I'm a really nice person and a hard worker with a lot of knowledge from different things. But one of my weaknesses is that I don't like to market myself that much, but hopefully my work speaks for itself.
